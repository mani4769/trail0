   <h2>Research Scientists/Engineers:</h2> <h4>Responsible for conducting research in computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing to develop algorithms for sign language detection. They explore novel approaches to improve<br>accuracy and efficiency in recognizing sign language gestures.</h4>

<h2>Software Developers:</h2> <h4>Design and implement software systems that utilize the algorithms developed by the research team. They work on creating user-friendly interfaces for sign language detection applications, whether they're standalone software or integrated into existing platforms.</h4>

<h2>Data Annotation Specialists:</h2> <h4>Curate and annotate large datasets of sign language gestures, which are crucial for training and testing machine learning models. They ensure the accuracy and consistency of annotations to improve the <br>performance of detection algorithms.</h4>

<h2>User Experience (UX) Designers:</h2> <h4>Collaborate with software developers to design intuitive and accessible interfaces for sign language detection applications. They focus on creating designs that are visually appealing and easy to navigate<br>for both sign language users and others.</h4>

<h2>Accessibility Experts:</h2> <h4>Provide insights into accessibility best practices and ensure that sign language detection technology is inclusive and usable for individuals with hearing impairments. They work closely with UX designers<br> and developers to address accessibility concerns and optimize user experience.</h4>

<h2>Project Managers:</h2> <h4>Coordinate the efforts of the team members, set project goals and timelines, and ensure that the sign language detection project stays on track. They communicate with stakeholders, allocate resources, <br>and monitor progress to ensure successful project completion.</h4>

<h2>Quality Assurance/Test Engineers:</h2> <h4>Conduct rigorous testing of sign language detection systems to identify and address any bugs or issues. They develop test plans, perform automated and manual testing, and provide feedback to the develop<br>-ment team to improve the reliability and accuracy of the technology.</h4>

<h2>Domain Experts:</h2> <h4>Collaborate with the team to provide domain-specific knowledge and insights into sign language linguistics and culture. They ensure that the technology accurately interprets and respects the nuances of dif<br>-ferent sign languages and dialects.</h4>

<h2>Deployment and Integration Specialists:</h2> <h4>Assist in deploying sign language detection systems in real-world settings, whether it's integrating them into existing communication platforms, assistive devices, or public spaces. They address technical chal<br>-lenges related to deployment and provide support for end-users.</h4>

<h2>Ethics and Privacy Experts:</h2> <h4>Consider ethical implications and privacy concerns associated with sign language detection technology, particularly regarding data collection, usage, and potential biases. They ensure that the technology is developed and deployed in a responsible and ethical manner, respecting the rights and dignity of sign language users.</h4>
